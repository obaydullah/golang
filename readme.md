## My first Golang programme

#### Download Golang from here

> <https://go.dev/dl/>

Basically a Golang file has three steps. First we need to give a name like that

> **package.main**

then we can import import other packages if we need

> **import "fmt"**

then we can start our main function

> **func main(){.....everything goes here }**
